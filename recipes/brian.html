    <h1>Briam (Greek Baked Zucchini and Potatoes)</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/images/image.jpeg" alt="Brian">
    <p>
      Briam is a traditional Greek roasted vegetable dish with potatoes,
      zucchini, tomatoes, and red onions with lots of olive oil.
      It is a typical example of Greek cuisine where a few simple
      ingredients are turned into an utterly delicious dish with
      little effort. It can be served as a main course.
      With olive oil as the only source of fat it is a quintessential
      example of the Mediterranean diet, and it is vegan to boot.
      If preferred, serve with a hearty chunk of feta on the side.
